# Bank-Account---OOP-in-C-
A bankaccount model using C# language implementing OOP
This is a model of a bankaccount while each of the files representing each module of a bankaccount. I also added a few more files representing an Interest earning account,
Credit account (where one can do an overdraft of the initial balance) and a gift card account  where after every month if the balance is not 0, then a deposit is made.
I used all the OOP principles in this small project as a way to learn both the language better and OOP as a coding style.
